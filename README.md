# Power-Considerations

This repository contains code for simulating the powers of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Anderson-Darling two sample tests. Both files use three distributions when obtaining the simulated sample, namely Cauchy, Laplace, and normal. Furthermore, each file considers a different method of obtaining an alternative distribution. The first shifts the center of the distribution by 1 whereas the second changes the spread by a factor of 2.  Finally, the size of the alternate distribution was varied as n = 10, 20, 30, 40 and 2n = 20, 40, 60, 80 (equal sample sizes and unequal sample, respectively).
