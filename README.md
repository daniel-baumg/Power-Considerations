# Power-Considerations

This repository contains code for simulating the powers of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Anderson-Darling two sample tests. EqualSizeCenter.R, EqualSizeSpread.R, UnequalSizeCenter.R, and UnequalSizeSpread.R use three distributions when obtaining the simulated sample, namely Cauchy, Laplace, and normal. Furthermore, each file considers one of two methods for obtaining an alternative distribution. The first method shifts the center of the distribution by 1 whereas the second changes the spread by a factor of 2. Finally, the size of the alternate distribution was varied in separate files as n = 10, 20, 30, 40 and 2n = 20, 40, 60, 80 (equal sample sizes and unequal sample sizes, respectively). esc.R also used the T distribution with 10 degrees of freedom and Folded Weibull (defined as the distribution symmetric about zero for which the absolute value of the random variable has a Weibull distribution with shape parameter 1.5).
